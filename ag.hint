Judges' comments:

    To use:
	make ant
	./ant 'ERE' [file ...]

    where:
	ERE 	is an extended regular expression
	file	a file to process (default is stdin)
    
    You may also want to try the author's test suite:
	make -f ant.test.mk
    
    See the author's Posix P1003.2-like documentation file ant.doc
    for more information.

    This program demonstrates that Posix doesn't guarantee readability.  :-)


Selected notes from the author:

    Some of the features of my entry are:

       o  "Lengthy" POSIX.2 style specification and manual :) :) 
       o  Useful subset of POSIX.2 Extended Regular Expressions.
       o  Recursive ERE parser/compiler that generates an NFA railroad. 
       o  Lazy NFA to DFA evaluation to improve performance speed.
       o  Code tested on a variety of platforms.
       o  Make driven test script.
       o  Can be compiled with ANSI or K&R C.
       o  Not a toy, but actually useful and usable on systems that use DOS.
